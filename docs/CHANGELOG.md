# CHANGELOG.md — every merged PR, tagged to the feature it touched

The **streamlined, human-readable lens over `main`'s merge history.** The raw
`git log` is noisy — early PRs landed as merge-commits that dragged their WIP
onto `main`, later ones as clean squash lines — so this file is the canonical
"what shipped, when, and to which part of the product" record. `HISTORY.md`
tells the *story* (what was asked, how it felt); this file is the *ledger*.

**Keep it current:** every time a PR merges, add one row to the release log
below and, if it opens a new area, a line under "By feature area." This is now
part of the merge ritual (see `CLAUDE.md` → "Git & merge discipline").

## Feature tags

Every change is tagged to the surface it touches. A PR that spans two surfaces
carries both tags (primary first).

| Tag | Surface |
|---|---|
| `foundation` | Core platform, monorepo, wire protocol, licensing, CI, clone-readiness |
| `canvas` | The tldraw surface: tool rail, presence, tidy, boards panel, board search, chrome |
| `cards` | Card shapes, action bar, drag, rich/dashboard cards, tables, provenance |
| `agents` | Server runtime, Ask router, Thinking Machines, research answers, recipes, generation feel |
| `onboarding` | Intent/persona onboarding, ambient scene, demo content, first-touch entry points |
| `landing` | Marketing page: hero, showreel, OG/favicon, copy |
| `embeds` | Marketing embed / iframe isolation + fixes |
| `deploy` | Hosting, GitHub Pages, the hosted trial |
| `docs` | Documentation and process |

## Why the raw history looks erratic (two merge eras)

- **Era 1 — merge-commits (PRs #1–#19, Jul 6–8).** Merged with
  `Merge pull request …`, so every intermediate WIP commit ("WIP: landing
  bento…", "Hero showreel: recolor the You cursor rust red") is stitched onto
  `main`. That's the tangle you see in `git log`.
- **Era 2 — squash-merges (PRs #20+, Jul 8 onward).** Each feature collapses to
  a single titled commit ending in `(#NN)`. Clean, one-line-per-feature.

Going forward we **squash-merge only** (codified in `CLAUDE.md`), so `main`
stays one-line-per-feature. This changelog papers over Era 1 retroactively.

## Explored but not shipped (closed without merge)

Kept here so the ideas aren't lost and nobody re-spikes them by accident.

| PR | Area | Idea | Why parked |
|---|---|---|---|
| #3 | `canvas` | Jarwiz cursor entity: idle roam, flies to new cards | Superseded by the presence-etiquette model (#40) |
| #4 | `agents` | Ultra Think mode: grounded content discovery | Folded into the Ask router's shape system |
| #8 | `cards` | Smart response-shape inference in the prompt bar | Landed differently via the "/" mode chip (#7) |
| #46 | `onboarding` | Onboarding scene retires on first board touch | Reworked into ambient-scene containment (#49) |

## In flight (open drafts)

_Snapshot as of 2026-07-18. Move each to the release log as it merges._

| PR | Tags | State |
|---|---|---|
| #79 | `docs` | Roadmap note: the advisor tool as an Autopilot-era execution model. Docs-only. |
| #76 | `cards` · `docs` | Thesys study + richer product dashboard card (viz tokens, KPI/chart polish). |
| #74 | `deploy` · `landing` | Capture beta signups + send a confirmation email (Resend, env-gated). |
| #72 | `docs` | Persona study: Airbnb-laundry market study + Jarwiz eval. Eval harness + docs. |
| #64 | `agents` · `docs` | Prompt-assembly cleanup + response-quality A/B harness (real sidecar). |
| #36 | `docs` | 100-case stress harness + report. Verdict now predates ~70 commits; re-run before trusting the "100/100" claim. |
